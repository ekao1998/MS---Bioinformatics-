# Background

The Royal Prince turns 16 in a couple of weeks. In anticipation of his birthday, all villages around the kingdom host week-long feasts to celebrate their beloved Royal Prince, and his Highness the King traditionally rewards the villages that holds the most extravagant feast with anything from reduced levy rates for the whole year or a whole year's worth of harvest. This being a very special birthday (after all the Prince is turning into a man) it is rumored the King has a special prize in mind which is the integration of one villager into nobility as one of the Great Ruling Houses. 
For the lucky chosen villager and their family this would mean a brand-new castle and close counsel to the King himself for the villager and his future descendants. For the village, this change would mean more representation at the Royal Court and thus better prosperity.
Needless to say, all villages in the kingdom have taken the rumors to heart and are working overtime to throw the best feast ever to grace the kingdom. The case is no different for the village of Sedonia where the usual sedentary and provincial life of the tiny village seems to have taken by the buzz and excitement of the upcoming festivities.

# ACT 1
## SCENE 1

Mirabel (player character) fades into scene in her cottage. 

She sees a note left by her father. It asks her to look for him urgently.

She meets her father Hamlin outside the house when he explains to her he is looking for his most cherished gift that he claims the King once gave him a long time ago and a letter that he received from a messenger the month before, also from the King, with some extremely confidential and critical message.

Mirabel has never seen the cherished gift nor the letter his father talks about but promises to look for clues to help her father find them.

Dialog
Mirabel: Dad! What's wrong? You seem quite worried
Hamlin: Oh honey! The king will have my head on a pike for this, yes he will! What shall I do?
Mirabel: What happened? 
Hamlin: Oh the most unspeakable happened, that's what. I lost a cherished gift from the king that he gave me many seasons back and a very confidential letter he gave me the other day.
Mirabel: The King sends you letters and gifts?
Hamlin: Yes, yes he's an old friend. An old friend who's going to execute me if I cannot find them again.
Mirabel: What does it look like? May be I can help you look for it?
Hamlin: The gift is a regular-looking gold coin, but has the insignia of House Covingtomb engraved on one side.
Mirabel: House Covingtomb insignia, the raven perched on a tombstone?
Hamlin:  Yes, yes. The letter has the insignia too, you can't miss it. Now hurry my dear and help me find it.

## SCENE 2

Outside the house, the villagefolk are buzzing about their day, decorating their houses or singing or dancing or drinking themselves to a stupor even though it is fairly early in the morning
Mirabel’s elderly neighbor, Dorothy is sitting on a bench outside her house looking wistfully into the sky in apparent daydream. When Mirabel approaches her she professes her desire to be wed to the royal Prince once he comes of age. Mirabel decides not to point out the fact that Dorothy is probably three times the royal Prince’s age and in stead tells her the prince would be so lucky to have Dorothy as his wife. 
Mirabel then tells Dorothy about her father’s missing letter.  Dorothy replies that she does not know about the letter but explains that late last night she saw someone hovering near Mirabel and her father’s residence who she thought looked rather suspicious. She describes the person as lean, tall, young with funny looking moustache and long beard.
Mirabel thanks her neighbour and sets off to investigate the new clue.

Dialog
Dorothy : Darling Mira!
Mirabel : Oh, Dorothy you look lavish today.
Dorothy : Well I must. For my charming prince.
Mirabel : The Prince?
Dorothy : None other. He turns into a man in a few weeks. He will need a princess. Which is why I sit here looking all princess-y until he notices me.
Mirabel : Well, I doubt the prince comes out this far but he would be so lucky to have you as his princess.
Mirabel : My father lost something very important. He's turned the house upside down looking for it.
Dorothy : Curious you say that my child. I saw a man hovering outside your house at witching hour last night.
Mirabel : Really, what did he look like?
Dorothy : Tall, lean with a funny-looking long beard and the most foul of intentions dictating his every action.
Mirabel : He might have stolen Papa's gift. Did you see where he went?
Dorothy : Hmm can't quite remember. But I saw him leave the tavern earlier in the evening.
Mirabel : Oh, thank you Dorothy. I must go now.
Dorothy : Ok, dear be careful. Don't go alone. Take that new boy Nicholaus with you to keep you safe.
Mirabel : Whiny little Nicholaus? No thanks. I'll be fine on my own, don't worry.

## SCENE 3


Mirabel hurries off towards the forest. ALong the way she notices something dropped on the ground. She moves closer to inspect it. It appears to be a gold coin. Is it her father's missing gold coin? She picks it up to inspect it with her magnifying glass and realizes it is not her father's missing coin. But there is another house insignia engraved on one side. Her heart skips a beat when she recognizes it. The insignia of House Ginezin, one of the most feared houses of the Kingdom.

Dialog
Mirabel: That...looks like... 
Mirabel: That's the House Ginezin insignia on this coin.
Mirabel: Oh no. What sort of trouble has the old man got us into now?.


END Narration

"House Ginezin is one of the most ruthless and feared houses of the kingdom."
"There have been reports for eons of how the House has crushed opposition and dissenters using threats or blackmail or outright torture and forced disappearances."
"All of this of course being the unofficial reports. Because of their methods they have proven most useful to the king and House Covingtomb who as a result have turned a blind eye to the activities of House Ginezin."
"What interest do they hold with Sedonia? Did they still Hamlins gift and the letter from the King?"
